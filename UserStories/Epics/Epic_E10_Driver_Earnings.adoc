== Epic Overview

== Epic Summary

**Golden Path Coverage:**

No stories in Epic E10 are required for the Golden Path. This entire epic is enhancement content for Phase 2-3 demos.

**Implementation Notes:**

* Earnings dashboard (D-E10-01) is important for driver satisfaction and retention
* Quality metrics (D-E10-02) support platform quality but are less urgent than earnings transparency

**Business Value:**

Epic E10 has strategic value for driver retention:

* **Earnings transparency:** Builds trust, helps drivers optimize work schedules
* **Performance feedback:** Improves overall platform quality
* **Quality coaching:** Reduces poor service incidents

These features are critical for driver-side product-market fit.

**Development Sequence:**

Sprint 5 (Enhancement):

1. D-E10-01: Earnings dashboard (critical for driver satisfaction)

Phase 3 (Optional):

1. D-E10-02: Quality metrics (quality assurance)

**Demo Timing:**

If including in Phase 2 demo, dedicate 1 minute:

- 45s: Show earnings dashboard with today/week/payout details
- Optional 15s: Point out quality rating briefly

**Demo Positioning:**

For Phase 1 (MVP Demo): Skip or mention in passing after job completion ("Mike earned $12.50 - he can track all earnings in his dashboard")

For Phase 2 (Enhanced Demo): Include D-E10-01 to show driver value proposition

For Phase 3 (Complete Demo): Add D-E10-02 to demonstrate quality management

Use Epic E10 to demonstrate to investors that Kurrier:
1. Treats drivers fairly with transparent earnings
2. Respects drivers as independent business owners
3. Provides tools for drivers to succeed
4. Maintains quality through feedback, not punishment

This is important for driver acquisition and retention strategy discussions.

**Comparison to Competitors:**

If relevant for investor pitch:

- "Unlike traditional courier services, drivers see real-time earnings"
- "No hidden fees or deductions - complete transparency"
- "Drivers control their schedule - work when they want"

**Integration with Job Completion:**

When Mike completes a job (D-E9-05):
1. Show "Job Complete!" with earnings ($12.50)

This creates a satisfying closure to the driver's journey.

**Payout Simulation Note:**

For demo, use realistic payout schedule:

- "Weekly payouts every Friday"
- "Direct deposit to bank account"
- "No minimum threshold - get paid for all completed jobs"
- Current balance: $340.25
- Next payout: Friday (3 days away)

If asked about low ratings or quality issues:
