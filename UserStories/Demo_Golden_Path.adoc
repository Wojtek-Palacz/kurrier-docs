== Demo Narrative

=== The Story

**Sarah** needs to send a birthday gift to her mom across the country. It needs to arrive by Friday, and she's booking on Wednesday. She uses Kurrier to get instant quotes from multiple carriers and book a pickup - all without leaving her home.

**Mike** is an independent driver working afternoons in Sarah's area. He accepts her pickup job through the Kurrier driver app, navigates to her location, collects the parcel, and drops it at the FedEx hub - earning $12.50 for a 15-minute job.

**Result:** Sarah's package enters the FedEx network within an hour of booking, she has complete tracking visibility, and Mike has earned money on his flexible schedule.

== Q&A Preparation

=== Anticipated Questions & Answers

**Q: How do you make money?**

A: "We take a service fee on each transaction - a percentage of the shipping cost paid by the consumer. Think of it like how Uber works but for packages. The fee covers platform operations, payment processing, insurance, and driver verification."

**Q: What about insurance and liability?**

A: "Built-in insurance up to declared value, with optional additional coverage available. Drivers are independent contractors who must carry their own vehicle insurance. Platform provides backup coverage for parcel loss or damage during pickup and hub delivery."

**Q: How do you ensure driver quality?**

A: "Multi-layer verification: background checks, document verification (license, vehicle, insurance), customer ratings after each job, photo verification at pickup and drop-off, and QR code scanning to prevent errors. Low-rated drivers are offered coaching or removed."

**Q: What if the driver damages the package?**

A: "Photo evidence at both pickup and hub drop-off. If damage occurs during our portion (pickup to hub), our insurance covers it. Customers can file claims directly in the app with photo evidence."

**Q: How is this different from scheduling a carrier pickup directly?**

A: "Speed, flexibility, and choice. Carrier pickups often require scheduling days in advance, pickup windows are wide (4-8 hours), and you're locked into one carrier. Kurrier: book in minutes, pickup in under an hour, choose from multiple carriers with instant quotes."

**Q: What's your take rate?**

A: [If asked by investors] "We're targeting 15-20% service fee on the base shipping cost. Drivers keep 100% of their earnings from the job payout we show them. Example: $18 shipment, carrier cost $15, driver pays out $3, platform fee $3, net to us $0 initially (scaled economics improve this)."

**Q: How do you handle peak times or driver shortages?**

A: "Dynamic pricing - surge pricing during high demand periods, similar to ride-share. This incentivizes more drivers to go online when needed. We also show heatmaps to drivers so they can position themselves in busy areas."

**Q: What if my package doesn't arrive on time?**

A: "Once the package is handed to the carrier at the hub, delivery timing is managed by them (FedEx, UPS, DHL). We provide the carrier tracking number for end-to-end visibility. Our SLA covers pickup timing - if a driver doesn't show within the promised window, we offer compensation."

**Q: Can businesses use this?**

A: "Absolutely. Business accounts get features like: business profile with tax ID on invoices, bulk shipping capabilities (future), saved addresses and templates, expense reporting exports. Same great service, business-focused tools."

**Q: What cities are you launching in?**

A: [Depends on actual plan] "Starting with Phoenix metro, expanding to LA, San Diego, Dallas, and Austin in Year 1. Focus on Sun Belt cities with geographic spread and strong e-commerce activity."

== Demo Troubleshooting

=== Common Issues & Solutions

**Issue: OTP doesn't auto-fill**

Solution: Manually enter 123456 (consumer) or 654321 (driver). Keep moving.

**Issue: Map doesn't load**

Solution: Say "Simulated map data" and proceed. Use screenshot backup if available.

**Issue: App crashes or freezes**

Solution: Have backup device ready with same demo state. "Technical difficulties - let me switch devices." Seamless recovery.

**Issue: Timing is off (going too fast or slow)**

Solution: Use natural pauses for talking points. Speed up boring parts (address entry), slow down exciting parts (quotes, driver acceptance, tracking updates).

**Issue: Audience can't see screen**

Solution: Use screen mirroring. Walk closer with device. Narrate what's happening verbally. Have screenshot deck as backup.

**Issue: Questions interrupt flow**

Solution: "Great question - let me finish this one step and I'll come right back to that." Or: "Hold that thought - you'll see the answer in just a moment." Answer during natural pauses (e.g., after booking confirmed, after job accepted).

**Issue: Demo feels too long**

Solution: Skip optional steps: Skip C-E1-03 (profile setup), Skip C-E2-05 (AR measurement), Skip D-E10-01 (earnings deep dive), Briefly mention C-E6-02 (invoice) without opening. Core flow can be done in 7 minutes.

**Issue: Demo feels too fast/shallow**

Solution: Linger on key moments: Expand quote price breakdown, Show driver card details longer, Pause on timeline updates to let them sink in, Show invoice details more thoroughly. Can extend to 12-13 minutes.
