== Executive Summary

Kurrier Inc. is developing a dual-app, on-demand parcel pickup experience that connects consumers and businesses with major courier networks (e.g., FedEx, UPS, DHL) via a flexible driver fleet that transports parcels to pre-assigned hubs. This brief specifies high-fidelity, clickable visual mockups (not production code) for four surfaces: Consumer Mobile, Driver Mobile, Web Admin Dashboard, and Consumer Web Dashboard.

*Purpose* - Validate UX/UI, flows, and business rules end-to-end—from booking and live multi-carrier quotes to pickup, hub handover, tracking, invoicing, rewards, and post-booking changes.

*Included* - Detailed flows, screen maps, components/patterns, interaction & accessibility notes; simulated API touchpoints (maps, quoting, payments, notifications); conceptual data model; acceptance criteria; and a full handoff package (design tokens, redlines, copy deck).

*Not included* - Production back-end, live carrier/payment/KYC integrations, or PCI processing (visual placeholders only).

*Outcome* - A realistic, clickable UI that demonstrates the full journey and confirms requirements, enabling accurate estimates and a smooth transition into MVP planning and the PRD phase.

== Purpose

Design and deliver two clickable, high-fidelity mobile visual mockups (iOS/Android) to:

* Visualize the full product concept end-to-end.
* Validate UI/UX decisions, process flows, and feature feasibility with stakeholders and test users.
* Establish the visual and interaction baseline for MVP implementation.

[NOTE]
====
This engagement is for visual mockups only (no production back-end). States and data may be simulated, but user journeys must be complete and realistic.
====

== Scope of Work (In-Scope)

* *Two separate visual mockups*
** *Consumer App:* Sender books pickup → gets instant multi-carrier quote → pays → hands parcel to driver → tracks to hub → gets invoice.
** *Driver App:* Driver verifies account → accepts jobs → navigates → collects parcel with photo/scan → drops at assigned hub → tracks earnings.

* *Full journey coverage* including: AR dimension measure, sender & recipient addressing, service selection, live quotation (multi-carrier), pickup ETA with live courier map, payment, handover, tracking/timeline, invoice/receipt.

* *High-fidelity UI* with a component library/design tokens (typography, color, spacing, elevations, states) and accessibility notes.

* *Interaction notes* for transitions, gestures, and loading/skeleton patterns.

* *visual mockup API stubs* (read-only, simulated) for: maps/geolocation, quoting, payments, notifications, courier status.

* *Handoff pack* with redlines/specs, copy deck, and a developer walkthrough.

=== Explicit Out-of-Scope (visual mockup Phase)

* No live integrations (carriers, payments, KYC, etc.).
* No PCI scope or storage of real payment data.
* No production infra, SRE, analytics pipelines beyond simulated events.

== Success Criteria (visual mockup Gate)

* *Completeness:* All primary and secondary flows listed below are realistically represented end-to-end.
* *Traceability:* Each screen and interaction maps to a defined user story and acceptance criteria.
* *Usability:* Clear information hierarchy, consistent components, accessible tap targets (≥44px), contrast compliance for core flows.
* *Handoff Quality:* Organized Figma files, named layers/components, design tokens, redlines for critical screens, copy deck included.

== Target Platforms & Devices

* Mobile phones only (portrait): iOS (390×844 pt baseline), Android (411×891 dp baseline).
* Provide adaptive guidance for common small/large phone sizes.
