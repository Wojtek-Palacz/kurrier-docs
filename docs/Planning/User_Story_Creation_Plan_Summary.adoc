== Overview: At a Glance

[.lead]
**Strategic plan to transform the Kurrier UX/PRD Brief into a structured backlog of 44 user stories for interactive demo development**.

.Overview: At a Glance
[cols="<1,<4"]
|===
^| *Objective* ^| Transform 17-page UX/PRD brief into actionable user story backlog
| *Scope* | Consumer Mobile App + Driver Mobile App (primary focus)
| *Output* | 44 user stories across 10 epics with MoSCoW prioritization
| *Approach* | Hybrid journey-priority model with INVEST validation
| *Timeline* | 1 week for complete backlog creation
| *Purpose* | Enable phased interactive demo development
|===

[IMPORTANT]
====
**Key Constraint:** This is for visual mockup/demo scope only, not production implementation. All APIs and data will be simulated.

== Story Quality: INVEST Criteria

Every user story validated against:

.Story Quality: INVEST Criteria
[%header, cols="^2,<4,<3"]
|===
^| Criteria ^| Definition ^| Validation Method

| *I* ndependent
| Can be developed without strong dependencies
| Review dependency list

| *N* egotiable
| Details can be refined during implementation
| Story describes "what" not "how"

| *V* aluable
| Clear value to user/stakeholder
| "So that" clause present

| *E* stimable
| Team can estimate effort
| Size assigned (S/M/L)

| *S* mall
| Appropriate scope for demo mockup
| 1-3 screens per story

| *T* estable
| Acceptance criteria are verifiable
| Given-When-Then format
|===

[TIP]
====
**Story Template Example:**

*As a* consumer, +
*I want to* enter my pickup address with autocomplete suggestions +
*so that* I can quickly specify where my parcel is located.

*Acceptance Criteria:*

* Given I type 3+ characters, when I pause, then I see address suggestions
* Given I select an address, when I confirm, then I see it on a map
* I can add special pickup instructions (gate codes, hours)

== Questions & Discussion

.Common Questions & Answers
[%header, cols="<2,<3"]
|===
^| Question ^| Answer

| Why not write stories directly from the brief?
| The plan ensures systematic coverage, prioritization, and quality validation. Ad-hoc story writing often misses dependencies and produces inconsistent quality.

| Can we start with fewer epics?
| Yes, the Golden Path (E1-E5, E7-E9) is minimum viable. E6 and E10 are enhancement epics that can be deferred.

| What if the brief is updated?
| Traceability matrix enables impact analysis. Affected stories are identified and updated systematically.

| How do we handle edge cases?
| Document as "Could Have" or "Won't Have" stories. Demo focuses on happy path; edge cases are production scope.

| Who approves story prioritization?
| Product Owner with stakeholder input. MoSCoW framework provides structured decision process.
