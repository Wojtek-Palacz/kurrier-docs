[%header, cols="<2,<3,<3"]
|===
^| Issue ^| Problem ^| Fix

| **Too Technical**

| **Missing Value**
| "So that" clause is vague or missing
| Add clear benefit from user perspective

| **Too Large**
| Story spans multiple screens or flows
| Break into multiple stories or consider making it an epic

| **Too Small**
| Story is a single button or field
| Combine with related interactions

| **Not Testable**
| Acceptance criteria are vague (e.g., "looks good")
| Use specific, measurable criteria

| **Circular Dependencies**
| Story A depends on B, B depends on A
| Refactor to break circular dependency
