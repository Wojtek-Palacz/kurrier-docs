**Format:** `[Actor]-E[Epic]-[Number]`

**Actor Codes:**

* `C` = Consumer
* `D` = Driver
* `A` = Admin

**Examples:**

* `C-E1-01` = Consumer, Epic 1, Story 1 (Consumer sign-in)
* `C-E2-04` = Consumer, Epic 2, Story 4 (Enter parcel weight)
* `D-E8-04` = Driver, Epic 8, Story 4 (Accept job)

**Benefits:**

* Unique and sortable
* Actor immediately visible
* Epic grouping clear
* Sequence within epic obvious
* Brief for verbal communication

=== Priority Definitions (MoSCoW)

**MUST HAVE (M) - Demo Blockers**

* Required for Golden Path narrative completion
* Without these, the demo story doesn't make sense
* Core value proposition is invisible without them

**SHOULD HAVE (S) - Demo Enhancers**

* Significantly improve demo believability
* Show important features but not Golden Path critical
* Add depth to user experience understanding

**COULD HAVE (C) - Nice-to-Have Features**

* Further enhancements if time permits
* Secondary features that add realism
* Features that demonstrate scalability

**WON'T HAVE (W) - Explicitly Deferred**

* Out of scope for initial demo
* May be included in enhanced demo v2
* Documented for future reference

=== Size Definitions

.Story Size Guidelines
[%header, cols="^1,<3,<3"]
|===
^| Size ^| Complexity ^| Example

| S (Small)
| Single simple screen
| Text input, static list view

| M (Medium)
| Screen with interactions
| Search + map + confirmation

| L (Large)
| Complex multi-screen flow
| AR measurement walkthrough
|===

=== INVEST Criteria

Every user story should meet these criteria:

* **I** - Independent: Can be developed without strong dependencies
* **N** - Negotiable: Details can be refined during implementation
* **V** - Valuable: Clear value statement in "so that" clause
* **E** - Estimable: Team can estimate effort (aided by size indicator)
* **S** - Small: Appropriate scope for demo mockup
* **T** - Testable: Acceptance criteria are verifiable
