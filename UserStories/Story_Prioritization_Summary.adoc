|===

<<<
== Won't-Have Features (Not in Story Backlog)

**Definition:** Explicitly deferred features that are out of scope for the interactive demo but may be included in production MVP or future versions.

=== Consumer Web Dashboard

**Why Won't Have:**
- Demo focuses on mobile apps (primary use case)
- Web dashboard is secondary channel
- Mobile-first strategy for initial launch

**Future Consideration:**
- Phase 2 product after mobile app validation
- B2B customers may require web access for bulk shipping

---

=== Full Admin Dashboard (Epic E11)

**Why Won't Have:**
- Operations management is not customer-facing
- Demo audience is customers and drivers, not operations staff
- Admin features don't demonstrate core value proposition

**Future Consideration:**
- Required for production launch
- Monitoring, support, dispute resolution, driver management
- Can be shown separately to operations-focused stakeholders

---

=== Help/FAQ/Support Content

**Why Won't Have:**
- Content creation is out of scope for mockup phase
- Can be represented with placeholder "Help Center" buttons
- Actual content developed during PRD phase

**Future Consideration:**
- Required for production - customer support and education
- FAQ based on common questions during beta testing

---

=== Complex Edge Cases

**Why Won't Have:**
- Payment retry flows
- Detailed surcharge handling (volumetric weight adjustments)
- Change/cancel flows with time-based windows
- Dispute resolution workflows
- Multi-parcel bookings

**Why:**
- Add complexity without improving value proposition demonstration
- Edge cases don't help stakeholders understand core product
- Better addressed in production implementation

**Future Consideration:**
- All required for production
- Documented in PRD for development team

== Prioritization Decision Framework

Use this framework when evaluating new feature requests or re-prioritizing existing stories:

=== Must-Have Criteria

A story is Must-Have if it meets ALL of these conditions:

1. **Golden Path:** Required for the end-to-end demo narrative
2. **Value Visibility:** Without it, core value proposition is not demonstrated
3. **Integration Critical:** Needed for critical consumer-driver integration points
4. **User Blocker:** User cannot proceed without this functionality

**Example:** C-E2-01 (Enter pickup address)
- ✓ Part of Golden Path (booking flow)
- ✓ Without it, cannot get quotes (value invisible)
- ✓ Required for creating job (integration)
- ✓ User blocked from proceeding

---

=== Should-Have Criteria

A story is Should-Have if it meets ANY of these conditions:

1. **Significant Enhancement:** Dramatically improves believability or professionalism
2. **Differentiator:** Shows innovative feature that sets Kurrier apart
3. **Business Critical:** Important for specific customer segment (e.g., B2B)
4. **Trust Builder:** Significantly improves confidence in platform quality

**Example:** C-E2-05 (AR measurement)
- ✓ Differentiator: Innovative feature competitors don't have
- ✓ Significantly enhances perceived quality
- Not required for basic booking flow (manual entry works)

---

=== Could-Have Criteria

A story is Could-Have if:

1. **Nice to Have:** Adds realism or completeness but not critical
2. **Secondary Use Case:** Supports less common scenarios
3. **Engagement Feature:** Improves retention but not core functionality
4. **Already Implied:** Can default or skip without breaking demo narrative

**Example:** C-E6-03 (View rewards balance)
- Engagement/retention feature
- Not needed to demonstrate core value
- Can be mentioned without full implementation

---

=== Won't-Have Criteria

A feature is Won't-Have if:

1. **Out of Demo Scope:** Doesn't demonstrate customer-facing value
2. **Content Heavy:** Requires content creation beyond mockup scope
3. **Edge Case:** Complex scenario not needed for understanding
4. **Secondary Channel:** Web dashboard when mobile is primary

**Example:** Admin Dashboard
- Not customer-facing (demo audience is customers/drivers)
- Doesn't demonstrate value proposition
- Can be addressed separately if needed

<<<
== Re-Prioritization Guidelines

If scope needs to be reduced or expanded:

=== Scope Reduction (Urgent Timeline)

**First:** Remove all Could-Have stories (7 stories removed)
- Impact: Demo still comprehensive, loses some polish
- Time saved: ~1 week

**Second:** Remove non-critical Should-Have stories
- Remove C-E2-05 (AR measurement - complex)
- Remove C-E5-04 (Contact driver - not essential)
- Remove D-E9-06 (Photos - optional)
- Impact: Demo still solid, less innovative
- Additional time saved: 3-4 days

**Last Resort:** Simplify Must-Have stories
- Remove C-E5-02 (Live map) - show timeline only
- Combine address entry screens
- Simplify quote display
- Impact: Demo still works but less impressive
- Additional time saved: ~1 week

---

=== Scope Expansion (Extra Time)

**Priority 1:** Promote critical Should-Have to Must-Have
- C-E6-02 (Invoices) - important for B2B
- C-E2-05 (AR measurement) - strong differentiator
- D-E10-01 (Earnings) - driver value proposition

**Priority 2:** Add selected Could-Have features
- C-E1-04 (Business profile) - if B2B focused
- C-E3-05 (Filter/sort) - if emphasizing choice
- D-E10-02 (Quality metrics) - if emphasizing platform quality

**Priority 3:** Add Won't-Have features selectively
- Admin dashboard overview (1-2 screens)
- Consumer web dashboard mockup
- Additional edge case flows
