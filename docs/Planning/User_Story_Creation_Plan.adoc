<<<
== Phase 2: Story Development

=== Step 3: Story Decomposition Methodology

==== Decomposition Process

For each epic, follow this systematic 6-step process:

**Step 3.1: Extract User Goals from Brief**

Review the relevant brief sections and identify discrete user goals.

*Example from Consumer Epic 2 (Shipment Creation):*

* Brief Section 4.1.2 lists: "Pickup Address", "Recipient Address", "Parcel Capture", "Service Selection"
* Brief Section 14.3 shows screens: "Pickup (search/map/saved)", "Recipient (search/map/delivery type)"

*Convert to user goals:*

* User needs to specify where parcel is located
* User needs to specify where parcel should be delivered
* User needs to provide parcel dimensions
* User needs to provide parcel weight

**Step 3.2: Write Story Statement**

Apply the standard user story template:

[source]
----
As a [actor],
I want to [goal]
so that [value].
----

*Example:*

[quote]
As a consumer, I want to enter my pickup address with autocomplete suggestions so that I can quickly specify where my parcel is located without typing the full address.

**Step 3.3: Define Acceptance Criteria**

Use Given-When-Then format or checklist style:

*Example:*

[source]
----
Acceptance Criteria:
- Given I am on the pickup address screen
  When I type at least 3 characters
  Then I see address suggestions from geocoding API (simulated)
- Given I select an address from suggestions
  When I tap to confirm
  Then I see the address displayed on a map for visual verification
- I can edit or change the selected address before proceeding
- I can add special pickup instructions (gate code, reception hours)
- Selected address is saved to my profile for reuse in future bookings
----

**Step 3.4: Add Context Notes**

Include:

* *Brief Reference:* Section and screen name
* *Technical:* API simulation notes, platform considerations
* *UX:* Interaction requirements, design system notes
* *Dependencies:* Other stories that must be complete first

*Example:*

[source]
----
Notes:
- Brief Reference: Section 14.3 - Addressing screens
- Technical: Uses Google Maps/Mapbox API (simulated for demo)
- UX: Show map confirmation as per brief requirement, support both manual entry and selection from suggestions
- Dependencies: Requires C-E1-02 (Location permission granted)
- Screen Count: 2 screens (search/entry + map confirmation)
----

**Step 3.5: Assign Priority & Size**

* *Priority:* Must/Should/Could/Won't (MoSCoW)
* *Size:* S/M/L based on complexity

|===
^| Size ^| Complexity ^| Example

| S (Small)
| Single simple screen
| Text input, static list view

| M (Medium)
| Screen with interactions
| Search + map + confirmation

| L (Large)
| Complex multi-screen flow
| AR measurement walkthrough
|===

**Step 3.6: Apply INVEST Checklist**

Validate each story against INVEST criteria:

* [ ] *Independent:* Can be developed without strong dependencies
* [ ] *Negotiable:* Details can be refined during implementation
* [ ] *Valuable:* Clear value statement in "so that" clause
* [ ] *Estimable:* Team can estimate effort (aided by size indicator)
* [ ] *Small:* Appropriate scope for demo mockup
* [ ] *Testable:* Acceptance criteria are verifiable

==== Story Template

[source,asciidoc]
----
=== Story [ID]: [Short Title]

**Story ID:** [Actor]-E[Epic]-[Number]
**Priority:** [Must/Should/Could/Won't]
**Size:** [S/M/L]
**Actor:** [Consumer/Driver/Admin]

**User Story:**

As a [actor],
I want to [goal]
so that [value].

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] Given [context], when [action], then [outcome]
- [ ] [Additional criteria]
- [ ] [Edge case criteria]

**Notes:**

- Brief Reference: Section X.X, Screen: [screen name]
- Technical: [API/mock notes]
- UX: [Interaction notes]
- Dependencies: [Story IDs]
- Screen Count: [number]

**Demo Notes:**

[Any specific notes for demo implementation]

---
----

==== Decomposition Strategy by Epic Type

Different epic types require different decomposition approaches:

**Onboarding Epics:**

* One story per authentication method
* One story for each permission request
* One story for profile setup

**Data Entry Epics:**

* One story per major form or input group
* Consider grouping related fields
* Separate validation as needed

**Selection/Browsing Epics:**

* One story for list/grid display
* Separate story for filters/sort
* Separate story for detail view

**Transaction Epics:**

* One story per transaction step (review → pay → confirm)
* Include success and failure states

**Tracking/Viewing Epics:**

* One story for main view/dashboard
* Separate stories for interactions (refresh, contact, etc.)

=== Step 4: Prioritization Framework (MoSCoW)

==== Priority Definitions

**MUST HAVE (M) - Demo Blockers**

* Required for Golden Path narrative completion
* Without these, the demo story doesn't make sense
* Core value proposition is invisible without them

*Examples:*

* Consumer: Sign in, Create shipment, Enter addresses, Get quote, Pay, View tracking
* Driver: Sign in, View jobs, Accept job, Navigate, Scan parcel, Complete pickup, Drop at hub
* Cross-cutting: Status updates, live map, basic timeline

**SHOULD HAVE (S) - Demo Enhancers**

* Significantly improve demo believability
* Show important features but not Golden Path critical
* Add depth to user experience understanding

*Examples:*

* Consumer: AR measurement, Insurance add-on, Saved addresses, Rewards balance display
* Driver: Heatmap, Earnings breakdown, Photo capture
* Polish: Loading states, error messages, empty states

**COULD HAVE \(C) - Nice-to-Have Features**

* Further enhancements if time permits
* Secondary features that add realism
* Features that demonstrate scalability

*Examples:*

* Consumer: Shipment management (reschedule/cancel), Business profile toggle, Promo codes
* Driver: Quality metrics, Incident reporting
* Admin: Basic monitoring view

**WON'T HAVE (W) - Explicitly Deferred**

* Out of scope for initial demo
* May be included in enhanced demo v2
* Documented for future reference

*Examples:*

* Consumer Web dashboard (use mobile app for demo)
* Full Admin dashboard (operations can be implied)
* Complex edge cases (payment retry flows, detailed surcharge handling)
* Help/FAQ/Support content

<<<
== Phase 3: Integration & Delivery

=== Step 5: Dependency Mapping & Sequencing

==== Dependency Types

**1. Hard Dependencies (Blockers)**

Story B cannot be implemented until Story A is complete.

*Example:* "View tracking timeline" depends on "Complete payment" (need booking to track)

**2. Soft Dependencies (Logical Flow)**

Stories work better when implemented in sequence.

*Example:* "AR measurement" ideally comes after "Manual dimensions" (fallback established first)

**3. Cross-Actor Dependencies**

Consumer story requires corresponding Driver story.

*Example:* "View driver location" (Consumer) depends on "Accept job" (Driver)

**4. Data Dependencies**

Story requires data/state created by another story.

*Example:* "View invoice" requires "Payment completed" state

==== Dependency Layers

Stories are organized into six dependency layers:

==== Critical Integration Points

The following diagram (see <<Golden Path Definition>>) shows the key integration points between Consumer and Driver apps:

.Critical Integration Points Details
[%header, cols="^1,<3,<2,<2"]
|===
^| # ^| Integration Event ^| Consumer Story ^| Driver Story

| 1
| Booking Confirmed → Job Created
| C-E4-03: View booking confirmation
| D-E8-02: Job appears in list

| 2
| Job Accepted → Location Sharing
| C-E5-02: Driver location visible
| D-E8-04: Accept job

| 3
| Parcel Scanned → Timeline Update
| C-E5-01: Timeline updates to "Picked up"
| D-E9-03: Scan Kurrier ID at pickup

| 4
| Hub Drop-off → Completion
| C-E5-01: Timeline shows "At Hub" + C-E6-02: Invoice generated
| D-E9-05: Scan at hub and mark complete
|===

These integration points represent the critical synchronization moments where the demo must show real-time coordination between both apps to demonstrate the platform's value proposition.

- **Requires:** [Story IDs that must be complete first]
- **Enables:** [Story IDs that this story unblocks]
- **Integrates with:** [Story IDs that work in concert]
- **Data needs:** [What data/state this story requires]
- **Data provides:** [What data/state this story creates]
----

*Example:*

[source]
----
**Dependencies:**

- **Requires:** C-E4-02 (Payment completed)
- **Enables:** C-E5-01, C-E5-02, C-E5-03 (All tracking stories)
- **Integrates with:** D-E8-02 (Creates job in driver's list)
- **Data needs:** User authentication, shipment details, selected service
- **Data provides:** Kurrier ID, carrier tracking number, booking status
----

==== Risk Mitigation Strategies

**Risk:** Long-pole stories delay entire demo

*Mitigation:*

* Identify complex integrations early (Layer 4-5 stories)
* Use mocked data initially, integrate real flow later
* Create API contracts/"seams" for parallel development

**Risk:** Cross-actor dependencies create bottlenecks

*Mitigation:*

* Develop Consumer and Driver flows in parallel through Sprint 3
* Use stubbed/simulated state for testing until Sprint 4 integration
* Test integration points early with smoke tests

**Risk:** Scope creep during implementation

*Mitigation:*

* Strict adherence to MoSCoW priorities
* "Won't Have" list is documented and respected
* Change requests require re-prioritization discussion

=== Step 6: Deliverable Specification

==== Document Structure

The user story backlog will be delivered as a structured set of AsciiDoc documents:

==== Story ID Convention

**Format:** `[Actor]-E[Epic]-[Number]`

**Actor Codes:**

* `C` = Consumer
* `D` = Driver
* `A` = Admin

**Examples:**

* `C-E1-01` = Consumer, Epic 1, Story 1 (Consumer sign-in)
* `C-E2-04` = Consumer, Epic 2, Story 4 (Enter parcel weight)
* `D-E8-04` = Driver, Epic 8, Story 4 (Accept job)
* `D-E9-03` = Driver, Epic 9, Story 3 (Scan Kurrier ID)

**Benefits:**

* Unique and sortable
* Actor immediately visible
* Epic grouping clear
* Sequence within epic obvious
* Brief for verbal communication ("C-E-one-oh-one")

== Risk Management

=== Identified Risks

.Identified Risks
[%header, cols="<1,<2,<1,<2"]
|===
^| Risk ^| Description ^| Impact ^| Mitigation

| Story Explosion
| Too many granular stories
| High effort, low value
| Maintain screen-level granularity; combine related micro-interactions

| Incomplete Requirements
| Brief doesn't cover edge cases
| Gaps in story coverage
| Document assumptions; mark stories as "requires clarification"

| Scope Creep
| Adding features beyond brief
| Timeline impact
| Strict MoSCoW adherence; defer to Won't Have

| Integration Complexity
| Cross-actor dependencies underestimated
| Demo flow breaks
| Map integration points early; validate in Sprint 4

| Stakeholder Disagreement
| Prioritization disputes
| Rework required
| Involve stakeholders early; document rationale

| Template Rigidity
| Template doesn't fit all stories
| Forced, awkward content
| Allow template variations with justification

| Time Underestimation
| Story writing takes longer than planned
| Delayed delivery
| Use pilot epic to calibrate; adjust plan

| Technical Feasibility
| Some features can't be mocked credibly
| Demo believability
| Identify early; adjust Should/Could priorities
|===

=== Contingency Plans

**If story count exceeds 50:**

* Review for over-decomposition
* Combine related micro-interactions
* Consider deferring Could-have stories

**If integration points are too complex:**

* Simplify Golden Path to essential interactions only
* Use "fade to black" transitions for complex state changes
* Document real implementation complexity separately

**If stakeholder feedback requires major changes:**

* Re-run prioritization workshop
* Update traceability matrix
* Version control allows rollback if needed

**If timeline is compressed:**

* Focus on Must-have stories only (Phase 1)
* Document Should/Could stories as outlines
* Plan follow-up iteration for enhancement stories

<<<
== Conclusion

This plan provides a comprehensive, systematic approach to creating a high-quality user story backlog for the Kurrier interactive demo. By following the six-step process outlined in this document, the team will produce:

* **44 well-formed user stories** organized into 10 logical epics
* **Clear prioritization** enabling phased demo development (MVP → Enhanced → Complete)
* **Complete traceability** from brief requirements to implementable stories
* **Coherent demo narrative** showcasing end-to-end value proposition
* **Documented dependencies** enabling logical implementation sequencing

The deliverables from this plan will serve as the foundation for mockup development, stakeholder validation, and eventual transition to MVP implementation.

**Next Step:** Begin execution with infrastructure setup and pilot epic (E1 - Consumer Onboarding).
